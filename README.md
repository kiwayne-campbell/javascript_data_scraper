- found a cool ebscarper I am modifying myself to leanr how to build and build t my own requirements. Next phase will eb to add a front end on this scraper. So it will parse words from a serach box to input the URL and word scrape manually.
# To do:
- figure out how to put absdolute links into one array
- add in response state error messages

# How to run
- run node then crawler file e.g node crawler.js (first was a basic version then second version is amended customised to my needs-still a work in progress)
